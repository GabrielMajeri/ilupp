This project provides Python bindings for the ILU++ package for incomplete LU
factorization via pybind11. ILU++ is described in the publication

Mayer, J. (2007), ILU++: A new software package for solving sparse linear
systems with iterative methods. Proc. Appl. Math. Mech., 7: 2020123-2020124.
doi:10.1002/pamm.200700911

The original ILU++ homepage seems to be lost to time, and there is little
documentation beyond some comments in the source code. Nevertheless, the Python
bindings provide a simple interface to either solve a linear system in a
black-box way, or to compute a preconditioner and apply it to a vector.  In
both cases, the matrix should be provided as a Scipy CSR or CSC matrix.
